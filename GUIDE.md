# GUIDELINE in STEPS

## Step 1: Define Core Problem

```python
start_thinking_session(
  problem="Training a DQN-based Forex RL agent with minimal state, but code is fragmented, redundant, and misaligned with prepared dataset",
  success_criteria="Trainable model on GPU with reusable code structure and correct data pipeline",
  constraints="No fake data, reuse libraries, only GPU training for now"
)
```

---

## Step 2: First Principles Breakdown

```python
add_thought(content="We only need 3 core modules: Env (state/reward), Agent (act/train), and Trainer (loop)", confidence=0.9)
add_thought(content="Data is already preprocessed. Any code generating fake data is wasteful", confidence=1.0)
add_thought(content="We already have utility libraries (risk, signal, etc.), reinventing them causes inconsistency", confidence=0.95)
```

---

## Step 3: Detect Reinvention

```python
detect_code_reinvention(
  proposed_code="Custom DataFrame simulator generating random OHLC",
  existing_packages_checked="simple_data_feed.py, processed_historical_data.csv"
)

detect_code_reinvention(
  proposed_code="Manual Q-learning loop with hardcoded reward logic",
  existing_packages_checked="forex_env.py, config/reward_config.yaml"
)
```

---

## Step 4: Package + API Exploration

```python
explore_packages(task_description="lightweight DQN implementations for single agent Gym env", language="python")
explore_packages(task_description="gym-compatible trading environments", language="python")
```

---

## Step 5: Memory and Risk Rule Consolidation

```python
store_memory(
  content="Reward design: symmetric TP/SL +10/-10 works best for discrete agent on forex; avoid MSE-style regression loss",
  tags=["forex", "reward", "risk"],
  importance=0.9
)

store_memory(
  content="Risk module should cap DD, max open positions, and optionally track exposure by currency pair",
  tags=["risk", "forex", "trading_env"]
)
```

---

## Step 6: Architecture Decision - Modular Structure

```python
record_architecture_decision(
  decision_title="Code Refactor: Modular RL Design",
  context="Too many demo/test files with overlapping RL code",
  options_considered="Single monolith script per run, class-based modular system, notebook-based workflow",
  chosen_option="Class-based modular with CLI",
  rationale="Reuse components across offline/online/live/demonstration pipelines",
  consequences="Need consistent interfaces for all agents and envs"
)
```

---

## Step 7: Project Refactoring Plan

```python
store_memory(
  content="Break system into: core/agent.py, core/model.py, env/forex_env.py, training/trainer.py, utils/logger.py, config/*.yaml",
  tags=["project_structure", "refactor"],
  importance=0.95
)
```

---

## Step 8: Validate Real Data Usage

```python
validate_package_usage("""
data = generate_fake_ohlc(1000)  # ‚ö†Ô∏è Not using real forex data
env = CustomForexEnv(data)
""")
# Warning: Use `load_processed_data()` from prepared data source
```

---

## Step 9: Rewrite CLI Launcher

```python
add_coding_thought(
  content="We should have one entrypoint file `run.py` that takes mode=train/test/live and config name",
  confidence=0.95
)

store_codebase_pattern(
  pattern_type="cli_launcher",
  code_snippet="""
if args.mode == 'train':
    train_loop(config)
elif args.mode == 'test':
    evaluate_model(config)
""",
  tags=["entrypoint", "cli"]
)
```

---

## Step 10: Auto-check Data Consistency

```python
add_thought(
  content="Training loop should validate data length, feature count, NaNs before starting",
  confidence=0.95
)

store_codebase_pattern(
  pattern_type="data_validation",
  code_snippet="""
assert data.shape[1] == config.input_size
assert not data.isna().any().any()
""",
  tags=["data", "robustness"]
)
```

---

## Step 11: Prevent Test Explosion

```python
add_thought(
  content="All demos must inherit BaseDemoRunner; forbid creation of adhoc `train_test_v9.py`, `demo1.py`, etc.",
  confidence=1.0
)

record_architecture_decision(
  decision_title="Prevent File Explosion",
  context="100+ redundant files for testing",
  options_considered="Free-form demos, class-based demos, CLI test manager",
  chosen_option="class-based DemoRunner",
  rationale="Centralized config, consistent evaluation logic",
  consequences="Need unified interface for test runs"
)
```

---

## Step 12: Enforce Config Consistency

```python
store_memory(
  content="All experiments should use YAML or JSON config files; hardcoded hyperparameters forbidden",
  tags=["config_management"],
  pattern_type="training_best_practices"
)

validate_package_usage("""
lr = 0.0003  # hardcoded!
""")
# Suggestion: Move to config/training.yaml
```

---

## Step 13: Add Config Generator

```python
add_coding_thought(
  content="Grid search and ablation studies require config combinator (e.g., with Hydra or simple YAML loader)",
  confidence=0.85
)

store_codebase_pattern(
  pattern_type="grid_config_generator",
  code_snippet="""
for lr in [0.001, 0.0003]:
  for eps in [0.1, 0.01]:
    config = base_config.copy()
    config['lr'] = lr
    config['eps'] = eps
    save_yaml(config, f"configs/run_{lr}_{eps}.yaml")
""",
  tags=["experiments", "config"]
)
```

# MATERIALS CHECK

## ‚úÖ Combined and Evaluated Summary of All Documents

---

### üìÑ **1. Claude-comments.md**&#x20;

* ‚úÖ *Correct bridge structure between Gym-Trading-Env and DWXConnect*
  **Reason**: Maintains consistency in state/action between training and live phases without rewriting the core environments.

* ‚úÖ *Minimal required code modifications stated clearly*
  **Reason**: Recommends extending only `tick_processor` in `dwx_client_example.py` and adding a bridge ‚Äî no overengineering.

* ‚ö†Ô∏è *Missing reward feedback in live execution*
  **Reason**: Only executes actions but doesn‚Äôt calculate and log live reward ‚Äî necessary for live performance monitoring or online learning.

* ‚ö†Ô∏è *No mention of risk management or position sizing*
  **Reason**: Assumes fixed 0.01 lots without adaptive control or drawdown protection, which is unsafe in volatile markets.

---

### üìÑ **2. Deepseek-2-projects.md**&#x20;

* ‚úÖ *Clear step-by-step pseudocode from training to live deployment*
  **Reason**: Follows the Deep Q-Learning loop structure properly with separation of training and inference.

* ‚úÖ *Training pipeline with DQN and replay buffer*
  **Reason**: Correctly uses experience replay and target network setup for DQN agent.

* ‚ö†Ô∏è *Action space limited to long/flat*
  **Reason**: Lacks shorting option and more flexible actions (e.g. lot sizes), which limits adaptability in real-world trading.

* ‚ö†Ô∏è *Risk management and reward shaping omitted*
  **Reason**: No logic for stop-loss, take-profit, or capital preservation, making it unsuitable for deployment without enhancement.

---

### üìÑ **3. new-idea-plan.md**&#x20;

* ‚úÖ *Modular architecture separating intelligence (local) and execution (VPS)*
  **Reason**: Reduces risk and improves flexibility by decoupling model decision logic from trading infrastructure.

* ‚úÖ *Comprehensive live data crawling and multi-timeframe feature generation*
  **Reason**: Includes RSI, SMA, volume normalization, and trend detection, aligned with how humans analyze markets.

* ‚úÖ *Signal structure matches DWXConnect format exactly*
  **Reason**: Prepares messages with symbol, order\_type, timestamp, and risk settings ‚Äî easy to parse on VPS.

* ‚úÖ *Telegram bot for secure, real-time signal delivery*
  **Reason**: Asynchronous, encrypted communication with authentication hash to ensure order integrity.

* ‚úÖ *Risk Manager handles drawdown, trade count, and position sizing*
  **Reason**: Prevents overtrading and enforces capital preservation rules per day and trade.

* ‚úÖ *Execution engine on VPS respects lot limits, symbols, and drawdown thresholds*
  **Reason**: Enforces centralized safety logic and order constraints before submission to MT4.

* ‚úÖ *Built-in metrics tracking, alerting, and model confidence thresholds*
  **Reason**: Adds Sharpe ratio, win rate, and confidence filtering to avoid reckless trades.

* ‚ö†Ô∏è *Missing online learning or real-time model updates*
  **Reason**: No active online training or continuous learning logic included in this version.

---

### üìÑ **4. qwen-2-project.txt**&#x20;

* ‚úÖ *Covers all 10 core Deep RL integration layers (model load, action mapping, training loop, backtesting)*
  **Reason**: Based on checklist from prior Claude and Assistant conversations.

* ‚úÖ *Includes model hot-swapping logic via file watcher*
  **Reason**: Enables production reliability when models are retrained or updated.

* ‚úÖ *Complete reward and experience replay integration*
  **Reason**: Adds TD-error, Q-value updates, and policy iteration loop support.

* ‚úÖ *Advanced backtesting with MultiDatasetTradingEnv and walk-forward validation*
  **Reason**: Helps assess model generalization across time and regimes.

* ‚ö†Ô∏è *No real code separation between training and execution*
  **Reason**: Mixing model inference with DWX client code could make debugging and scaling difficult.

------------------------------------------------

* ‚úÖ **Simplifying improves RL performance**
  The Snake game's DeepQ agent succeeds due to minimalism: 11 binary inputs, immediate binary rewards, and clean termination. Applying the same logic to Forex‚Äîreducing to 4 float features, binary rewards (+10/-10), and simple termination‚Äîmakes the environment easier to learn for the agent, reducing noise and overfitting.

* ‚úÖ **State complexity was a root cause of failure**
  `original_src.txt` used 13 engineered features (like volatility clustering, volume ratio, etc.) which increased dimensionality and noise. This contradicts the success principle of Snake, where state = \[11 binary values]. A simpler state with 4 features (momentum, position, PnL, session time) keeps learning focused.

* ‚úÖ **Reward engineering was overcomplicated and noisy**
  Previous versions used overlapping reward triggers (SL/TP, manual close, penalty on drawdown), creating ambiguous signals. Snake succeeds with immediate and clear binary rewards (+10/-10), which trading now mimics by rewarding only profitable closes. This helps the agent align actions with outcomes more effectively.

* ‚úÖ **Episode termination logic is now coherent**
  In `original_src.txt`, episodes could end due to multiple unrelated conditions (drawdown, equity, max steps), which confuses the RL loop. Simplified Snake-style logic (end at max step or end of data) makes training cycles predictable and stable.

* ‚úÖ **Refactoring into modular structure reduces code entropy**
  GUIDE.md reorganizes components into `core`, `env`, `training`, etc., following a modular RL pattern. This aligns with good software engineering and makes future experimentation (grid search, live trading) manageable. The previous code had logic scattered across scripts, increasing fragility.

* ‚úÖ **Binary reward formulation validated across domains**
  `README.md` reinforces this Snake-inspired reward system as ideal for real-time trading: binary outcome (+10/-10), fixed lot size, no technical indicators. This abstraction removes the need for arbitrary threshold tuning and simplifies RL gradients.

* ‚úÖ **Training loop is now maintainable and testable**
  The final Snake-style training loop avoids hardcoding (like fixed epsilon decay), encourages use of YAML config, and supports extension (e.g., replay buffer, dueling DQN). Previous loops mixed logic, logging, and control flow, making debugging harder.

* ‚úÖ **Bridge modules for live trading are non-invasive**
  Claude-comments.md proposed adding only one bridge module between Gym and DWX. This lets the same RL agent trade both in backtest and live, without changing the core model logic. It solves the deployment mismatch issue of previous versions.

* ‚úÖ **File structure avoids bloat and redundancy**
  The v4 directory is structured to avoid file explosion. Each script has a narrow purpose, and test/demo files are grouped, solving issues seen in older versions with scattered demo/test hybrids.

* ‚úÖ **Design supports future upgrades**
  While minimal now, the current system can scale: optional config files can enable advanced features like Sharpe-based rewards, volatility control, and multi-agent coordination. Starting simple allows gradual evolution, avoiding premature complexity.

**Perfect!** B·∫°n ƒë√£ c√≥ roadmap r√µ r√†ng r·ªìi. T·ª´ analysis n√†y, t√¥i th·∫•y b·∫°n ƒë√£ hi·ªÉu ƒë√∫ng problem v√† solution.

## **Key Takeaways ƒë·ªÉ implement V12:**

### **1. State Design (4 features only)**
```python
# Copy from Snake's compact approach
state = [
    price_momentum,     # like snake direction
    position_state,     # like snake body position  
    unrealized_pnl,     # like distance to food
    time_factor         # like frame iteration
]
```

### **2. Binary Rewards (exactly like Snake)**
```python
# Snake: +10 food, -10 death
# Trading: +10 profit, -10 loss
reward = 10 if pnl > 0 else -10 if close_position else 0
```

### **3. Clean Architecture**
```python
agent.py      # Copy structure, modify for 4 inputs
model.py      # Linear_QNet(4, 256, 3) 
forex_game.py # Rewrite play_step() for trading
trainer.py    # Keep Snake's while True loop
```

## **Action Plan for V12:**

1. **Strip down current forex_game.py** - remove all complex features
2. **Copy Snake's agent.py** - modify input size to 4
3. **Implement binary reward system** - no complex SL/TP logic
4. **Test on real data** v·ªõi simple state representation
5. **Validate convergence** tr∆∞·ªõc khi add complexity

## **Expected Outcome:**

V12 s·∫Ω converge nhanh h∆°n v√¨:
- ‚úÖ Reduced noise in state space
- ‚úÖ Clear reward signals  
- ‚úÖ Simple termination logic
- ‚úÖ Proven architecture (Snake works!)
