## **1. Về Core Module Structure**

Snake problem khác fundamentally:
- **Snake**: Deterministic environment, perfect information, clear objectives
- **Forex**: Stochastic, partial information, fuzzy objectives

Không thể copy mechanical được. Cần redesign:

```
core/
├── agent.py          # RL agent nhưng cho binary prediction 
├── model.py          # Neural net cho binary classification
├── features.py       # Feature engineering cho forex
└── environment.py    # Forex market simulation
```

## **2. Về Labeling vs Unsupervised Learning**

**Option A: Supervised Learning (Labeling)**
- Bạn label manually winning/losing patterns
- Train binary classifier predict up/down
- Pro: Faster convergence, interpretable
- Con: Requires domain expertise, static patterns

**Option B: Pure RL (Current approach)**  
- Agent discovers patterns through trial/error
- Pro: Adaptive, finds novel patterns
- Con: Slow convergence, reward engineering hard

**Hybrid approach có thể tốt hơn:**
- Start với rule-based labels để pretrain
- Fine-tune với RL để adapt

## **3. Binary Prediction Problem Reduction**

**Đúng rồi!** Problem có thể reduce thành:
- **Binary state**: Long vs Short (no Hold)
- **Time prediction**: WHEN to enter
- **Direction prediction**: UP or DOWN

**Simplified problem:**
```
Input: [price_momentum, volatility, session_time, ...]
Output: [probability_up, probability_down]
Action: Enter Long if P(up) > threshold
```

## **4. Session Timing & Volatility**

Bạn nhận ra điểm quan trọng:
- **Asian session**: Low volatility, ít patterns
- **London/NY overlap**: High volatility, clear trends
- **News events**: Spike volatility

**Solution approach:**
1. **Filter training data** - chỉ train trên high volatility periods
2. **Session-aware features** - encode London/NY overlap  
3. **Volatility threshold** - skip prediction khi volatility thấp

## **Concrete Next Steps (không copy Snake):**

### **Step 1: Data Analysis**
- Plot volatility by hour để confirm trading hours hypothesis
- Identify high-volatility periods in historical data
- Calculate win rate của simple rule-based signals

### **Step 2: Binary Classification First**
- Create labels: 1 if price higher after 1H, 0 otherwise
- Train simple neural net predict next hour direction
- Measure accuracy trên different sessions

### **Step 3: Feature Engineering**
- Price momentum (multiple timeframes)
- Volatility regime
- Session indicator (Asian/London/NY)
- Recent win/loss streak

### **Step 4: Timing Model**  
- Predict optimal entry timing within session
- Use classification confidence as position sizing

**Question back:** Bạn có data về news events không? Và bạn muốn start với supervised learning (labeling patterns) hay continue với pure RL approach?

## **Env Module Design - Forex-Specific**

### **base_env.py**
**Abstract base class định nghĩa interface:**
```python
class BaseForexEnv:
    def __init__(self, data): pass
    def reset(self): pass                    # Return initial state
    def step(self, action): pass             # Return (state, reward, done, info)
    def get_state(self): pass                # Current market state
    def get_portfolio_info(self): pass       # Balance, position, PnL
```

**Key differences từ Snake:**
- State không phải grid position mà là market features
- Reward không immediate mà có thể delayed
- Episode length variable (market hours vs fixed game)

### **forex_env.py** 
**Core H1 trading environment:**

**State representation (4-6 features):**
- Current price relative to recent range
- Position direction (-1/0/1)
- Unrealized PnL percentage
- Session indicator (Asian/London/NY)
- Recent volatility

**Action space:**
- 0: Close position
- 1: Enter/Switch to Long  
- 2: Enter/Switch to Short

**Reward function:**
- Binary: +1 profitable close, -1 loss close, 0 while holding
- Or continuous: actual PnL percentage

**Episode termination:**
- End of data
- Maximum drawdown hit
- End of trading session

### **hierarchical_env.py**
**Multi-timeframe logic:**

**Additional state features:**
- D1 trend direction (uptrend/downtrend/sideways)
- H1 vs D1 alignment (trend following vs counter-trend)
- Support/resistance levels từ higher timeframes

**Decision logic:**
- D1 bias influences H1 entry signals
- Only trade H1 signals aligned với D1 trend
- Position sizing based on timeframe confluence

### **gym_adapter.py**
**Wrapper cho compatibility:**

**Interface standardization:**
- Convert forex-specific actions to gym standard
- Normalize observation space to [-1, 1]
- Handle variable episode lengths
- Add metadata for trading-specific info

**Key methods:**
```python
def observation_space(self): # Define state bounds
def action_space(self):      # Define valid actions  
def render(self):            # Visualization for debugging
def seed(self):              # Reproducible episodes
```

## **Critical Design Decisions:**

### **1. Episode Structure**
**Option A:** Fixed length (e.g., 24 hours)
**Option B:** Variable length (session-based)
**Option C:** Event-driven (volatility-based)

### **2. State Normalization**
- Price features: Percentage change or z-score?
- Time features: Cyclical encoding (sin/cos) or linear?
- Position features: One-hot or continuous?

### **3. Reward Engineering**
- Immediate vs delayed rewards
- Risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe ratio)
- Transaction costs inclusion

### **4. Data Handling**
- Real-time simulation vs batch processing
- Missing data handling (weekends, holidays)
- Slippage and spread modeling

**Which aspect muốn focus đầu tiên?** Base interface design hay specific forex logic implementation?
